# RAG TOPIC SKILL

## Purpose
Define deterministic retrieval-augmented generation pipelines with grounded outputs and measurable evaluation.

## Hard MUST Rules
1. Retrieval, ranking, and generation stages MUST be explicit and logged.
2. Groundedness and citation integrity MUST be validated in tests.
3. Evaluation outputs MUST be structured and reproducible.
4. No real LLM/provider calls in automated tests.
5. Structured output models are mandatory.
